# UP HTTP Server

Wrapper around Flask / Waitress, dropping in as a replacement for the classic "python3 -m http.server". Useful for security testing ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. This was originally written to assist with WEB-300 (OSWE) coursework, so you may find it useful if you're attempting that... 

This tool has a couple of advantages over the simple version:
* Optionally show request headers -- useful for debugging or if you're looking for connections back from a target webserver
* Pretty colours to differentiate requests (can be disabled with `--accessible` or `-c`/`--no-colour`)
* Disable file-sharing (this increases security if you're only wanting connection info -- will respond with 404 to every request)
* Display information about the working environment (e.g. network addresses, current directory, files being served, etc) at start and whenever you press enter

UP Simple HTTP server for debugging / hacking

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Show request headers / information (you probably want
                        this active)
  -q, --quiet           Don't show information on startup
  -p PORT, --port PORT  The port to serve on. Defaults to port 80
  -i IP, --ip IP        The IP to serve on. Defaults to all interfaces
                        (0.0.0.0)
  --https, --no-https   Run HTTPS server.
  --cert CERT           Path to the certificate file.
  --key KEY             Path to the key file.
  -m MSG, --msg MSG     Message to respond to non-GET requests with. Defaults

  --ignore IGNORE       Query parameter which tells UP to ignore verbosity and
                        logging for the request. Defaults to 'ignore' (e.g.

## Installation Instructions

### Venv Installation

Literally just a (single file... for now... it's driving me bonkers) Python script. Do something like this to install dependencies and add the script to your PATH:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/up-http-tool --depth 1 up && cd up
python3 -m venv env
./env/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cat << EOF | sudo tee /usr/local/bin/up 2>&1 &>/dev/null
#!/usr/bin/env sh
$(pwd)/env/bin/python $(pwd)/up \$@
EOF
sudo chmod 555 /usr/local/bin/up
```

### Simple Installation (not good practice, but if you like living on the edge... do this)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/up-http-tool --depth 1 up
cd up
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/up /usr/bin/up
chmod 555 up
```

Note, this has been tested on Kali Linux... and that is it. I developed this to make life easier when testing webapps / applications that might callback over HTTP -- you are more than welcome to make use of it yourself, but please don't expect full product support!
